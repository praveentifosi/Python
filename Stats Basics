So, when is the skewness too much?
The rule of thumb seems to be:
If the skewness is between -0.5 and 0.5, the data are fairly symmetrical.
If the skewness is between -1 and -0.5(negatively skewed) or between 0.5 and 1(positively skewed), the data are moderately skewed.
If the skewness is less than -1(negatively skewed) or greater than 1(positively skewed), the data are highly skewed.

About kurtosis
1_Nqu07THa7APRTOF7kaVr5Q.jpeg

Mesokurtic: This distribution has kurtosis statistic similar to that of the normal distribution. It means that the extreme values of the distribution are similar to that of a normal distribution characteristic. This definition is used so that the standard normal distribution has a kurtosis of three.
Leptokurtic (Kurtosis > 3): Distribution is longer, tails are fatter. Peak is higher and sharper than Mesokurtic, which means that data are heavy-tailed or profusion of outliers.
Outliers stretch the horizontal axis of the histogram graph, which makes the bulk of the data appear in a narrow (“skinny”) vertical range, thereby giving the “skinniness” of a leptokurtic distribution.
Platykurtic: (Kurtosis < 3): Distribution is shorter, tails are thinner than the normal distribution. The peak is lower and broader than Mesokurtic, which means that data are light-tailed or lack of outliers.
The reason for this is because the extreme values are less than that of the normal distribution.¶
